"Just wanted to update with my personal experience so far, as I‚Äôd posted here with questions from before I‚Äôd started taking Aimovig.The shot itself was painless. I know some people find these uncomfortable but honestly for me I kinda barely felt it, though it did leave a pretty big bruise on my stomach.Couple of days of my stomach feeling not so great after taking it initially.Other than that, though it‚Äôs been great. I had a migraine the first and second days after taking it, but from there on in I experienced less pain when my head did hurt, and my migraine days went from 16 in the previous month to 7 in my first month on the drug.Just took my second shot today and feeling super hopeful about these results. I‚Äôve noticed some triggers will still set off a migraine (heavy exercise, alcohol, and strong cannabis) but other things that were triggers previously aren‚Äôt activating migraines as much as before (long drives, neck strain).Hoping months 2,3 and 4 just keep getting better and better. I took a long road trip driving in rain and air pressure variations, neck strain, etc and feel absolutely fine. I‚Äôm super impressed.Anyways just wanted to say if anyone here is on the fence about trying, this drug is absolutely worth a shot!",23
"I‚Äôm currently on Emgality monthly, with topiramate 125mg daily, and sumatriptan 50-100mg as an abortive. I just want to add to the pile, and perhaps help people feel better‚Äî I have a decent amount of body fat, and I‚Äôm a nurse. I am not afraid of needles or injections. I never flinched at Botox injections, tattoos, IVs, blood draws, or Aimovig. But fuck, Emgality hurts. I have to work up to it, and I‚Äôve put it off and taken it days late to avoid it. I try to relax my body and do some mindfulness breathing techniques. It helps some, Tensing up definitely makes it worse. Emgality is helping me for sure. But I hate injection day. And I wanted to vent to some understanding folks. üíï",24
"Anyone have experience with a CGRP that was working wonderfully, and then just stopped?  Ajovy was a lifesaver for 1 12 years and then it just didn‚Äôt seem to be working anymore.  I switched to a emgality, which worked the first two months, then was mediocre at best with unpleasant side effects.  Aimovig stops my bowels and makes me puke.  I‚Äôm disheartened but trying Botox next.I‚Äôm just so incredibly disappointed after having something that worked so well.",16
"I‚Äôve now tried all 3 of the cgrp migraine injections (aimovig, emgality, ajovy, in that order). And while everyone is going to have different experiences, I figured I‚Äôd share mine.With all 3, I used autoinjectors (ajovy has a syringe option as well). Ease of use of all 3 is similar, aimovig, IMO, is probably the most difficult because you need both hands (one to stretch the skin around the injection site, one to operate the pen). The injection pen on ajovy is different from the other two, in that there‚Äôs no button to start the injection - you press the pen into your skin and that triggers the injection process. Due to the design, emgality won‚Äôt fit in a lot of sharps containers. That sucker is tall and has a weird triangular thing at the end, so it won‚Äôt fit in the opening of commercial sharps containers. Emgality hurt the most, ajovy the least. I was super anxious about the first ajovy dose, but it was considerably less painful than emgality. Ajovy is also the only one that doesn‚Äôt cause bleeding for me.With all 3, I noticed a difference in my migraines (chronic, daily). None got rid of them completely, but I definitely noticed a difference, mainly in the couple days before and after the next dose, when the previous dose had worn off and the new one hadn‚Äôt kicked in yet. With aimovig I‚Äôd have about 5 days of awful headaches between the old dose wearing off and the new one kicking in. Emgality this period was much longer 7-10 days. Ajovy is the best as far as this goes, with only about 2.5 days of awful headaches. My doctor says that ajovy is designed to last 31 days and the others 27-28, and my experience definitely supports ajovy lasting longer. So, that‚Äôs my experiences with my tour of cgrp injectables. I‚Äôm sure everyone is different, but I figured I‚Äôd share, just in case it helps someone.",56
"Just wanted to add some positivity to the mix. Just did my first aimovig shot and I could barely feel it :) after imaging the worst, it was a pleasant surprise. Here‚Äôs to hoping it helps for me since nothing else has.",18
"Hi everyone- wanted to encourage folks to report side effects of the new drugs that have recently come out (Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, Ubrelvy, Reyvow.) Below is info about how to report side effects to the FDA and drug manufacturers. My understanding is that both types of reporting are important to get side effect lists updated. More accurate lists of side effects will help patients get appropriate treatment when side effects do occur and could inform future drug development.

I do the aimovig injection once a month and in the last week I start to get frequent headaches and dizziness. Does anyone else experience this?,19
"I just left my neurologists office (a migraine specialist) and she prescribed me Emgality. I live in southern Ontario. I had no idea Emgality was approved in Canada!I was on topiramate (for a few years) and Aimovig (for 9 months) and Aimovig suddenly stopped working a few months ago. Topiramate was not working very well the whole time (and is making me depressed among other strange side effects) and is not working well now. I have mild to moderately painful migraines ~2830 days a month now. Aimovig had me down to probably 4 migraine days a month!My neurologist told me to go off topiramate and take my last Aimovig shot this month, then we can start the Emgality paperwork in April. Apparently it was approved in Canada about 2 weeks ago. Similar patient support program to Aimovig (i.e. Novartis Go). She also said Ajovy is only a few months away as well!Looking forward to trying Emgality since Aimovig gave me my life back and I miss it. I have too much hope. And ready to go off topiramate, although Im scared of the next 4 months of no preventatives.Anyway, if anyone in Canada is in the same boat as me, Emgality is newly available! Talk to your neurologist!",20
"I‚Äôve had chronic migraines for the past 30 years with nothing really working for my 22 episodes per month with most of those being so intense that I‚Äôd miss work and personal life events and a trip to the ER was not unusual. I‚Äôve tried every kind of rescue medicine that either worked and then stopped working or never worked at all, daily preventatives, and treatments from Botox, needling, chiropractic sessions, etc. Weather is a huge trigger for me as are basically all preservatives, chocolate, alcohol, etc.  I chased my neurologist down waiting for these medicines to be approved and immediately tried Aimovig at the lower dose. It took a few months, but there was a vast improvement.  It truly changed my life. I‚Äôve been on it a year and am now down to 8-9 per month.  What I‚Äôve noticed is that my migraines are more responsive to the rescue meds for the most part. I‚Äôm 11 months in and I honestly would‚Äôve been happy with these results alone and was immensely grateful, but my neurologist said, let‚Äôs try the larger dose and see if we can knock them out all together. This is my first month at 140mg. Fingers crossed!I share all this you not to nullify other stories where the medicine didn‚Äôt work, but to say that it worked for me. For the person reading this that hasn‚Äôt tried an inhibitor and is considering it, there is hope.  I haven‚Äôt had any side effects. The constipation is not an issue for me because I‚Äôve had my gall bladder removed (so basically it‚Äôs close to impossible to constipate me!).  That seems to be one constant side effect other mention.For the person reading this who needed to see it, you‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs worth a try based on how this disease has robbed you of your life.  I can only speak for myself and with that I‚Äôd say that it has given me my life back.  I hope that you‚Äôll give yourself the opportunity to see if it works for you too. If you haven‚Äôt already, use Migraine Buddy. Track your migraines and measure the effectiveness. Best of luck to everyone reading this message. It‚Äôs chat groups like this that educate us further of the risks as well as the rewards and my heart goes out to all my fellow migraineurs.",27
"I was diagnosed with DRUG INDUCED LUPUS after taking Aimovig. My doctor believes Aimovig caused it.If you are having Lupus symptoms (fatigue, hair loss, increased headaches, jointmuscle aches, fevers) ask your doctor to do an ANA blood test and a HISTONE IGG AB blood test. The Histone blood test is specific for drug induced Lupus.Aimovig is not known to cause drug induced Lupus, but it has not been on the market long. My doctor said it will take time for a pattern to emerge. If you discover you have Drug Induced Lupus, please report it and share these blood tests with others as I believe most doctors will not think to look it.This is what rxlist wrote about the capability of Aimovig to cause an ‚Äúimmune response in the body‚Äù:[https:www.rxlist.comaimovig-side-effects-drug-center.htm#professional](https:www.rxlist.comaimovig-side-effects-drug-center.htm#professional) says:‚ÄúAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.‚ÄùWikipedia definition of **Immunogenicity**:‚ÄúThe ability of a particular substance, such as an antigen or epitope, to provoke an IMMUNE RESPONSE IN THE BODY (caps are mine) of a human and other animal.‚ÄùIf you do find you have Drug Induced Lupus, the good news is that its reversible ... once you stop the drug, the Lupus will eventually go away.I hope this is helps anyone having weird symptoms weeksmonths after taking Aimovig.",19
"So I just wanted to tell a story - I‚Äôm in a motel and watching tv with commercials for the first time in a long time. I was surprised to see a commercial for Aimovig! It‚Äôs one of those elaborate inspirational ads basically saying, ask your doctor about aimovig, don‚Äôt miss out on life, AIM to be here, live your life better with Aimovig, etc. I was laughing because they could have just made a commercial saying IT‚ÄôS HERE! THIS SHIT WORKS, GET SOME IF YOU CAN! that totally would have been enough. They didn‚Äôt have to sell me this miracle drug like a poignant big picture inspiring life changing thing üòÜ Anyway, glad to have Aimovig in my life. Commercial is silly. Drug is great.",19
"I was pretty leery of commiting to months of Aimovig being in my body because of the reports of side effects not listed by the pharmaceutical companies, such as body aches, brain fog, worse headaches etc. Especially considering they removed non-responders from the study (what happened to the non-responders?? Nothing? Did some get worsening symptoms??? Hmmmm).I went ahead 3 months ago at 70mg with some trepidation, Ive had some negative experiences with drug side effects. At first it was great, 10 days completely migraine free! After having 20-30 headches or migraines it was like walking though life on clouds.Then this persistent pressure headache with constant body aches and neck stiffness set in. I was foggy and weak, like having the flu. No rescue meds seem to work. 20 days of this until my next injection. Same thing, 10 days free 20 days of ouch.Saw my neuro today and it turns out my fears are substantiated. They just had a meeting this month discussing Aimovig and the clinical reports  coming in of side effects like mine, which she referred to as flu-like. She basically said everyone is learning as they go about this.I also asked about injecting 40mg every two weeks, I know some others were wondering this too. She said they dont know yet as the trials tested only on monthly but that this is something that is being looked into.Neuro said going to 140 might narrow that 20 day gap between injections may help so Im going to try that. If its an issue of Aimovig wearing off it should be positive. Hoping it doesnt get worse intead. Im not regretting trying Aimovig...yet.Tl;dr *Neurologists are seeing reports of flu-like side effects from Aimovig users despite this not being reported in trials. (This is burried somewhere in the Novartis website to, as side effects reported clinically post-trial)           *Aimovig is only approved for monthly injections. For now, they just dont know the potential implications of bi-weekly. Its being looked into.",17
"Has anyone else had crazy nightmares start right after beginning aimovig? Im talking very vivid dreams that literally could be horror movies playing through my head. I can manage this as a side effect as long as I get relief with the aimovig, I just want to know Im not alone.",16
"I‚Äôve seen a couple of individual posts about this but I thought it would be helpful to gather as much data as we have in one place! I‚Äôve had inconsistent results on Aimovig (just took my 5th shot) and I‚Äôm interested in trying one of the other meds. (I believe my insurance will only cover Emgality, not Ajovy). For those of you who started on Aimovig and then got on one of the others, what was your experience like?(Also, am I right to assume that EmgalityAjovy are relatively similar, or at least more similar to each other than they are to Aimovig, due to the way they work?)Thanks as always. It is so hard to maintain hope when I see how life changing these drugs have been for others (as thrilled as I am for EVERYONE who has that experience!).",19
"Began taking Aimovig mid August, 2018.  Migraines worsened for almost a week (making me VERY concerned), but¬†then about day five or six the WOW hit.  I awakened without¬†pain in the middle of the night, something which is quite the anomaly for me. ¬†Over the next four months¬†I largely¬†enjoyed a respite from the pain--that is, I still got hit with migraines, but I was able to use various assuagements that allowed me to function almost as a normal person.  Heck, I even travelled and enjoyed some beers, ales, mead, and wine here and there.  Amazing.  Never¬†had any problem with the injector.  No redness, hives, itching, pain.Yes, it backs you up,¬†to use a euphemism, but really...considering what one gets from this medication--potentially--I simply deal with it.Brain fog?  Oh, Ive got that anyway, whether from Imitrex or who-knows-what, so again, I dont worry¬†about it considering the benefits I get.Now when January came, I decided to try to switch to Emgality because I was told that I could get it free for a year AND¬†was¬†having to pay out of pocket for Aimovig.  So I went three months without Aimovig.  However, after¬†getting the runaround from all concerned, I never¬†was able to get any Emgality.  And heres where it gets interesting (I hope)--WOWZA did my migraines return with a vengeance!  OMG.  Every day and every minute I was clawing and scratching the migraine monster to¬†try and get some respite and relief, often to no avail, alas. ¬†During this time I used:ImitrexElectric neck¬†√•nd eye massageCefaly--for hours at a timeAnalgesicsLidocaine up my nose (on Q tip)Special straps Ive devised which¬†dig into the orbital pressure points that give me some reliefOther abortivesBut often nothing worked.Finally I decided to quit trying to get any Emgality and see if I couldnt somehow find a better deal on Aimovig.  Thankfully, I did! ¬†So a week ago I again injected Aimovig for the first time in three months.  I am now enjoying my se√ßond day free of migraine, and last night was even able to enjoy a few Saint Patricks Day¬†beers as I worked at the local pub (playing fiddle).  Thanks for reading.  Hope some of this info helps.  Btw, Ive had migraines my entire life, starting at age three my sister contends.  I used Caffergot and 222s as a lad, then combated them by¬†running and exercise from ages 15-35 or so‚Äì‚Äìand it worked, too‚Äì‚Äìbut by age 36 the migraines returned.  Since then Ive taken about everything.",29
"I took two doses of Aimovig over about two months and it cleared up my daily migraines after about 2-3 weeks, I was ecstatic. However, it also (I assume, as there have been similar reports and I couldnt find any other reason nor could doctors) affected my period in that I got my period 4 times in those two months and each time it lasted 11 days, seven days later I would get ANOTHER period. Not great, especially since I have anemia and have to take iron supplements.Today I took my first dose of Emgality, it has been a little over a month since my last dose of Aimovig, my headaches wereare returning very slightly due to the long break between doses  (this also happened between my first and second dosage because I got it later than I should have, but it was much more mild this second time) but nothing an OTC pain med like Aleve couldnt fix.The injection hurt slightly more than Aimovig or a regular shot, but was still fine. There was no cost (Emgality is free for a year if you have a prescription). I will post later if this works as well as Aimovig, and I will post if it doesnt. From what I have heard it should be fine and have fewer if any side effects although I only experienced the one noticeable side effect with Aimovig. Cheers! Feel free to PM me.",19
"Hi all. 25 yo NDPHer chronic intractable migraineur for 5.5 years. Ive had 3 Aimovig injections (Aug- 70mg, Sep- 70mg, Oct 5th- 140mg), and will be discontinuing due to zero benefit feeling worse.-Aimovig increased the following symptoms: brain fog, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, constipationslowed digestion. It caused the following side effects: late periods extra hormonal migraine agony, mild hair loss & chest pain, flu-like lethargy and sick feeling. My specialist (Dodick) would prefer I gave it a 4th go, but I believe I gave it a good enough SHOT, and Ive been feeling so much worse than my usual ever since (6 days after) my last injection Therefore, I will be switching to Emgality in December, once it has been at least 60 days since my last Aimovig shot (Dodicks request).- Also, it could be a coincidence, but I feel like Im having withdrawal pain now that my next shot is due in 4 days- the worst of my pain is dead center in the middle of my forehead (third eye area) and behindaround my eyes. This happened when my second shot was due too. Not sure what to make of that since I had ZERO pain improvement since starting 3 months ago. Also, the flu like symptoms have resolved this week, now that the medicine is the lowest in my system. -Anyway. Like everyone else who didnt respond to Aimvoig Im a bit devastated but trying to push on. Hopefully I wont have WORSE withdrawal type symptoms, or an even higher increase in pain than Im already having. This really sucks. Wanted people to know my experience with the drug, and also that those experiencing similar are not alone. Lets keep each other posted on here.",16
"Hi everyone, I made a [Spreadsheet](https:docs.google.comspreadsheetsd1Lsbn_GgmkEZsoJeSe1YOIvr9nqoBWlX-X1jJMj-bTpQedit?usp=sharing) gathering data from 69 redditors who have tried Aimovig for migraine. I did this for myself to make some sense out of all the noise, but decided it might be worth sharing. The link is editable so you can remove yourself if you dont want to be included, or addchange data as necessary. Where there was no data I just left the cells blank but they could be filled in with N for no or NA. I have a backup in case this one gets deleted or screwed up.&#x200B;Edit: My overall take away is that Aimovig is having some positive effect for the slim majority of people who take it. Hair loss seems to be the biggest side effect reported and is quite scary. Theres also a smaller set of people reporting constipation, injection site issues, dizziness, etc.",17

This works differently than Aimovig, and similar to all the others (works on ligand, not receptor).The obvious question that will come up: what if you combine aimovig (receptor-based) with ligand-based cgrp-modalities? Do you get a big bonus effect? That would be swweeeeeet. :)",17
"Note if you are getting free aimovig for the first couple of months, they will have a special pharmacydispenser contact you. At first they were like, you have to be home between 9 and noon to sign for it. It wasnt until I pestered them with Cant you deliver it to my pharmacist and then I pick it up from them? that they were like Oh right I forgot about that option. Internally I was like Yeah right sure you did but I was polite and just thanked them. It was super convenient. My pharmacist called me when it arrived. They kept it refrigerated and I was able to pick it up at my convenience instead of having to miss work.So glad I asked, as I really couldnt afford to miss work that day!",20
