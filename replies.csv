Im so pissed. I hate this. I feel like it was helping, so Im even more angry. Its just so painful that it nearly made me vomit and pass out, and I dont have enough fat anywhere else that I can easily reach myself, so into my thigh or nothing.

Only thing I have noticed (specifically from this subreddit) is a lot of people injecting it into their thighs. Maybe it’s just because I’ve got space for it but I always do my injections in my stomach a couple inches to either side of my navel. Had a couple that kind of hurt while injecting but no pain after it was done. That’s been about it. For the sharps issue I just put that triangular cap back on and throw the whole auto injector away. Never really been a concern."",""comment_13"":""I’m so glad you mentioned that Aimovig’s autoinjector is difficult to use. I struggled with those! It legitimately took two, sometimes three people to get those to fire for me. That, plus the early breakthrough at the end of the month and the constipation...I switched to Ajovy and it’s been SO much better. I even do the syringe for Ajovy (to avoid autoinjector issues) and it’s been completely painless, no bleeding either as you mentioned. The syringe still wigs me out sometimes but I pull through it. My migraines are extremely well controlled with ajovy and my migrainedopamax brain fog has cleared up substantially from ajovy as well. I saw a noticeable improvement in brain fog and reduced migraine days with Aimovig but ajovy just polished it up. I didn’t realize I was still experiencing symptoms (like general photosensitivity) while on Aimovig until ajovy improved things further."",""comment_14"":""This would be my third CGRP injectable too. I did them in the order of Aimovig, Ajovy and then emgality now. With the first two, since I am only one day post emgality shot now, my migraines did seem to resolve completely but it could have been the combination of injection and oral medication, aptiom. Aimovig caused me to have severe constipation that was just too much for me. I have ibs-d and thought to myself that it would even out the constipation side effect and boy was I wrong. Next I tried Ajovy. This one seemed to have even worse gastrointestinal side effects for me! The night I got the shot in my neurologist’s office I had what I thought was food poisoning, severe vomiting all night. I didn’t have diarrhea which I thought was strange and atypical of me for food poisoning but did not know any better at the time. I had to call off work that day which was embarrassing enough. After the initial bout of “food poisoning” I was left with severe nausea and was unable to eat anything for over 2 weeks. I was so nauseous the thought of food made me think I was going to vomit. After the two weeks I was able to eat one tiny meal a day. I lost almost 10 pounds in a month because I barely ate. I brought this up to my neurologist who immediately decided that we need to stop the medication for a month to see if my symptoms resolved once the Ajovy was out of my system. I waited and thankfully after a little over a month of having it in my system I was able to eat again. I still can only eat about half of what I used to which is helping with the needed weight loss but is still kind of scary. My neurologist then told me to make a report to the FDA about these side effects. I did do some research and found that the iv version of these meds did have severe nausea as a side effect but was shocked that the injections did not! Last night, after doing the emgality loading dose and first dose as instructed I started experiencing what I thought was a drysore throat on the right side. I thought to myself that it was just from a tonsil stone falling out that I knew happened recently on that side. I woke up this morning to both sides of my throat doing that. I’ve heard from other people that sore throat is a side effect but I am only one day into the injection and don’t want to jump to conclusions. I am just very discouraged because I have tried everything for these migraines; triptans, blood pressure meds, anti depressants, Botox, CGRP inhibitors, anti seizure medications, nerve block medications and even brain surgery, although for another reason but they thought I would have less migraines. Nothing works. I should rephrase that, either it works for a couple months and then stops working or the side effects are so unbearable that I stop. I’ve gained weight, lost hair, had numbness and tingling on one side of my body, lost weight, had gastrointestinal issues and all sorts of other nasty side effects. I am just done and don’t know where to go or if anything will help me. The only thing that seemed to work was the steroid, decadron, that they put me on post brain surgery to prevent swelling and even that had to be tapered faster than they wanted because of side effects. People thought I was going through menopause. I was so hot it was like a fire was burning inside of me 247 and nothing could put it out. I was uncomfortable and could not focus on anything and silly me for thinking I could take a chemistry class over the summer 4 days post brain surgery but I still managed to pass. The insomnia was horrible I didn’t sleep for days. But through all of that, I didn’t have a migraine at least. I know it takes a toll on those around me and not just myself so I try different things not only for me but so I don’t become a burden to those around me constantly caring for me during my frequent migraine attacks. Medication wise, my neurologists are out of ideas, they hit me with every top of the line drug they could and it wasn’t enough. Their only suggestions are acupuncture, nerve blocking shots or butterbur.""}]",56

"[{""comment_1"":""As I said in your other thread, immunogenicity is really the ability of a drug to induce an immune reaction to itself - that is, for the body to recognize it as foreign and mount a response including production of drug-specific antibodies, similar to how your body recognizes a regular pathogen (such as bacteria or virus) and responds to it. Immunogenicity is usually not used to refer to a drug having immune-modulatory effects, though obviously as you’re seeing that can happen. I’m not doubting what you are going through AT ALL, just trying to clarify some terminology. And yes, while we get a decent look at side effects during clinical trials, the patients enrolled are a limited demographic and don’t have nearly the span of medications and other health conditions that many of the rest of us mix with these new drugs. So, seeing new side effect profiles is not super unusual, and is why post-approval safety studies are done to monitor this.

I also have Occipital Neuralgia, BUT with Aimovig, I had quit taking all of the pain pills and muscle relaxers associated with it and was down to just taking one maintenance med. I was considering titrating off it, things were going so well. On the 5th month, something went wrong. I went from an insomniaclight sleeper my entire life to anytime I would sit down, I would fall asleep. To the point that my husband accused me of taking other drugs. My kids would lift my arms and legs up and I wouldn’t wake. My husband would clamp my nose shut. I wouldn’t stir a bit. Waited 6 weeks (6 weeks of hell), went in for my botox appt with my neuro this morning and she loaded me up with a Torodol shot (to hopefully break my pain cycle - it didn’t) and Emgality!Here’s to hoping I can get some peace back!""}]",19

(1-833-AIMOVIG (1-833-246-6844))You prescribing neurologist should have been aware of the available assistance for getting Aimovig from Amgen."",""comment_2"":""Happy to hear it works for you. Hopefully you can get it covered under your insurance plan soon...."",""comment_3"":""Aimovig has a co-pay plan, contact the manufacturer (Novartis). Do a google search for “Aimovig co-pay”. May be as low as $5-25month.""}]",29

"[{""comment_1"":""I hope Emgality works for you! My wife is considering trying the free year trial of it, shes never medicated for her migraines in the past but theyve been getting worse lately.I work for Lilly and can say its a great feeling seeing this drug have a positive impact on people. I actually helped make the last clinical trial batch of the drug."",""comment_2"":""Thank you so much for sharing! I haven’t even heard of Emgality until you posted this.  I’ve done 4 rounds of Aimovig with no improvement, and have intractable migraine.  I’ll be calling and asking my dr."",""comment_3"":""Let us know how it goes, good luck! I definitely had withdrawal when I stopped Aimovig a couple of months ago: my migraine symptoms returend, so I went up to 140mg and have been pretty happy with it. Unfortunately it looks like that didnt help you. :("",""comment_4"":""Also switching to Emgality and just took my first dose today. 3 months of Aimovig didn’t do much for my migraines, maybe a mild reduction in frequency and pain level. I dealt with nausea, reflux, muscle pain and cramping, appetite loss, and weird blood sugar crashes. I now seem to be lactose intolerant as well. I’m really hoping this one helps, although already nervous reading your comment about the recommended 60 day wait. My neuro said I could do it today (and she actually injected me in the office) instead of my 4th dose of Aimovig tomorrow. In all irony, as I was waiting for the Emgality autoinjectors to come up to room temp, I got a call from McKesson to schedule my second Aimovig delivery...  🤷🏻‍♀️"",""comment_5"":""I started Emgality (Loading dose) in November and had zero migraines for almost a month. Considering three to four or more a week for 50 years this seemed to be a miracle. Took the second dose in December and still working amazingly well, only one migraine, although it was a true head banger of the nth degree. But still only one. Took dose three in January and still doing well, with one head banger and one milder one.That said, I am a disabled vet and the VA has now approved Aimovig. If I switch the costs would be zero, versus about $210 per month on the Emgality as I dont have any commercial insurance for a free trial. I received my first Aimovig today and it is already useless as they failed to ship it with a cold pack. So it appears I will stay on teh Emgality for at least another month. I wonder if anyone has switched from Emgality to Aimovig and how long the waiting period is between the last injection of another formulation? Finally, has anyone experienced stiff neck and headache in back of head with Emgality? It started soon after the second dose and continues, but it definitely is not a migraine.Thank you, be safe and be well. \u0026#x200B;""}]",16
"[{""comment_1"":""This is great. thank you"",""comment_2"":""Awesome, thank you!!"",""comment_3"":""I just started it, you can add me. All I’ve noticed so far is extreme fatigue and chest pains. Went to the ER for the chest pains and they said it was probably a side effect of the medicine since everything else was clear. I’ve also got a migraine right now (day 3 since injection), so yippee. Super disappointed to see so many people reporting hair loss. My hair is falling out from something else (unrelated) so WTF, I hope Aimovig doesn’t make it worse. \u0026nbsp;Another good column to add might be 70mg versus 140mg..? I’m on 70."",""comment_4"":""I took my first Aimovig injection on October 8th. For two days following I was dizzy but then it tapered off. Nausea, loss of appetite, and constipation for me. No hair loss. Occasional racing heart and shortness of breath. I haven’t had a migraine since the injection and am feeling hopeful. I have migraine with brain stem aura. You can add me as well!"",""comment_5"":""Last month was my first month with Aimovig - 70mg.  I have had daily headaches for years and I had 15 headache free days during this past month.    I hope it wasnt a fluke and will be taking my second injection tomorrow.  Feel free to add me if you want."",""comment_6"":""You beautiful person! Thank you for this!"",""comment_7"":""This is so cool. I added myself.  For me the biggest side effects you have listed are insomnia and constipation, but I also get this amped feeling for a few days after injection (so maybe that is heartracing). It is almost euphoric really, like I feel ALIVE! It is kind of crazy. It can also be more of an anxious amped feeling at times. Has anyone else heard of this? Im on month 7 or something so I can confirm that it is consistently a side effect with the shots."",""comment_8"":""I added a line and made a row for percent who responded in the affirmative.

"[{""comment_1"":""Ive been wanting to know the answer to that! Can you combine the receptor and ligand based ones? Or the infusion one being developed by Alder Biopharmaceuticals, that they state is immediately bioavailable - will that become a mainstay of ERemergency stop measure for intractible migraine? FThree years from now, after we have more experience with these medications, what will the standard migraine treatment look like? What will the long term effects of these medications be? How will the still in clinical trials small molecule abortive cgrp medication compare to triptans? For people who dont respond to the cgrp medications, how long will it take for researchers to figure out why they dont? And how long after that will it take to develop additional medications to help them? So many questions, and such an exciting time to be alive :)"",""comment_2"":""Just asking - I wonder if they would still send it for free if I’m doing Botox. My ins co said they would cover one or the other only."",""comment_3"":""Wow, I never thought of combining the two. I just received my second dose of Aimovig and am about to start the process to get ongoing bridge coverage using the Ally Access Card. I could get start the process for a free trial with Emgality in parallel. Im going to guess that they arent as backed up as Aimovig has been.""}]",17
"[{""comment_1"":""Thank you! I was just worrying about how to make the timing work, I had no idea delivery to a pharmacy was a possibility. Phew!"",""comment_2"":""Note it seems McCarren Specialty Pharmacy (or whatever it is called) may now be refusing to do this. They did it for me again for my second dose, but they were weird about it and said they dont deliver to pharmacies. :(  I know it was the only serious option for me, as I dont want to stay home from work, but there is no way Im getting a medicine box fed-exed to myself at work, that is a serious privacy violation for me!"",""comment_3"":""Why not just have it delivered to your work if thats where you are going to be?"",""comment_4"":""I had mine sent to my doctors office. I actually paid for the first one and had it filled at CVS because I didnt want to wait, but they called and said they have one in their refrigerator with my name on it and will give it to me whenever I am ready.""}]",20
